# Introduction

This is *Neovim* version of [ediprolog](https://github.com/triska/ediprolog).
For all informations check out original Emacs version


## WIP Warning

This plugin is still work in progress, and I am not sure when it will be functional.

## Features

- [x] - simple consult of current (saved) buffer
- [x] - simple query
- [ ] - interactive query
- [ ] - scryer-prolog support

## Differences with original emacs plugin

- for now, buffer need to be saved for consulting (will change it eventualy!)
- When swi-prolog is working, i will try to make scryer-prolog working too
